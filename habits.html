        <li><b><big><u style="color:red;">Self-accountability</u></b></big></li>
        <p><i>Self accountability requires reveiwing one's conduct on a daily basis before going to sleep. If one's conduct has been good and feel good during the day, then one should keep it up and support it with similar or better productive works. However, if it has not been good, then one should do extra hardwork and strive against it to give the performance of their work up and make it a habit in future</i></b></p>
        <li><b><big><u style="color:red;">Hardwork</u></big></b></li>
        <p><i>Hard work is like planting seeds for success. It's putting in the effort, staying committed, and not giving up, even when things get tough. It's the key to turning dreams into reality and achieving goals. When you work hard, you discover what you're capable of, open doors to opportunities, and inspire others to do the same. It's the path to triumph and the sweet reward for persistent effort.</i></p>
        <li><b><big style="color:red;">Curiosity</big><u></u></b></li>
        <p><i>"Curiosity is the compass that guides you toward your goals. Let every question be a stepping stone, every answer a revelation. The path to success is not just about reaching your destination but relishing the discoveries along the way. Embrace the unknown, stay curious, and let the pursuit of your dreams be an endless adventure."</i></p>
        <li><big style="color:red;">Patience</big></li>
        <p><i>we see lot of successful people around the world but did you know their success is a product of multiple failures. If we want to acheive big success then we have to acquire <u>patience</u>. While working on a big result, we see lots of failure but the actual failed person is who scared to be fail and when fail , then surrender.But we have know that we see lots of failure while acheiving a big result , see the bill gates , see elon musk and also see many successful people that we know have to face the fear of failure and acquire patience while that situation happen</i></p>
        <li><big style="color:red;">Say NO</big></li>
        <p><i>when it comes to work, <u>say no</u>to everything that doesn't support your goals and values. We live in an abudant world-there are always enough opportunities. saying No that eliminates wasting time on shit that we are not excited about</i></p>
